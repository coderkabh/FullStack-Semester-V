        JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed
        by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced
        by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.
        JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's
        web browser rather than on the web server.

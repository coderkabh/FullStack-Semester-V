        HTML stands for Hyperlink Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages. Hypertext refers
        to the way in which Web pages (HTML Documents )are linked together. Thus, the link available on webpage is called  Hypertext.
        As its name suggests, HTML is a markup language that means you use HTML to simplify "mark-up" a text document with tage which
        tells a web browser how  to structure it to display. Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of
        documents like headings, paragraphs, links, ans so forth so facilitate the sharing of scientific infromation between researchers.

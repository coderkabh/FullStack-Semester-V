        Bootstrap, or bootstrapping, is a verb that comes from the saying, "to pull oneself up by his bootstraps."
        The idiom implies a person is self sufficient, not requiring help from others. Similarly, in the
        computing world, bootstrapping describes a process that automatically loads and executes commands.
        The most fundamental form of bootstrapping is the startup process that takes place when you start up a computer.
